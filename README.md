Stock Analyzer

This project is a React + TypeScript + Vite based web application that aims to analyze and visualize stock market data.
The goal of the app is to allow users to search for stock symbols, fetch live/ historical stock prices, and show them in a clean dashboard UI.

This project also uses Tailwind CSS for styling.
